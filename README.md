## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm Bill—a power industry professional with 20+ years of experience in power generation. These days, I'm diving into **data science, visualization, and machine learning** with the intention to uncover insights and make better decisions in power project development and operations.

🎯 **My Current Skills:**  
- SQL
- Python Data Analysis:
-- Data Manipulation and Cleanup with Pandas, Numpy, stats
-- Data Visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly  
-- Machine Learning Algorithms using python such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, for Classification and Regression  


🎯 **My Current Focus Areas for New Skills:**  
- Time Series Analysis  
- Neural Networks  
- Risk Analysis for Large Power Projects  

Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors; hiking with my dog, bike riding, skiing, the beach and cheering on Rutgers football/basketball.  Throw in travel with any of those and it only gets better! 🌍🏔️🚴‍♂️

## ✨ Fun Fact
A small percentage of power projects that are developed are actually permitted, and built.  Development is a risky business.  So any efforts to use data analysis, visualization or machine learning to apply resources to the right projects, over the wrong projects, or to the target the high risk areas on individual projects in development could yield a significant payback. 🏞️
